# Real-Time-Human-Posture-Detection-using-MoveNet
This project demonstrates a real-time human posture detection system using TensorFlow's MoveNet SinglePose Thunder model. The system captures live video feed, performs pose estimation to detect keypoints of the human body, and classifies the posture into predefined categories such as Standing, Sitting, or Squatting.
